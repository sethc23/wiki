First, mapping keys in some cases could be avoided by changing settings for keyboard behavoir. Settings on the Profiles tab, it may be useful to map one of the Option keys to ESC as show below for left option.

!(keycode_option_as_esc)


Unlike keycodes in Applescript, keycodes for terminal applications (e.g., iterm2) running on OSX use KEY CODE TYPE.

Mapping keycodes in iterm2 is simple with the help of this [Keycode Application](https://manytricks.com/keycodes/).

In irssi for example, the default keybinding to Switch between Previous and Next Windows is ESC+n and ESC+p, respectively.
